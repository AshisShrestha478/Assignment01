# 🛒 Grocery Management System  
**CS3354 – Assignment 1**

## 📌 Project Description
This project implements a simple grocery inventory management system using **parallel arrays** in Java.  

The system allows users to:
- View available inventory
- Restock existing items

The program demonstrates:
- Use of arrays
- Loops (for / while)
- Conditional statements
- Branch-based Git collaboration
- Javadoc documentation generation

## ⚙️ Features
- Display inventory (item name, price, stock)
- Search and restock items
- Case-insensitive string comparison
- Input validation using menu system
- Generated Javadoc documentation stored in `/docs`

## 🧠 Challenges Faced

### 🔹 Ashis Shrestha
Initially attempted to compare two `String` values using the `==` operator (similar to C++).  
Later realized that Java requires the use of `.equals()` to compare string content rather than memory references.

### 🔹 Puspa Raj Bhattarai
Experienced difficulty pushing to a branch on GitHub.  
The issue was resolved after discovering that the collaboration invitation had not yet been accepted.

### 🔹 Hayden Lovell
No major technical challenges were encountered during implementation.
